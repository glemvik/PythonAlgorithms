# Project overview

This project aims to provide clean, testing and well-documented implementations
of common and important algorithms in Python 3.6.

We strive to adhere to the following **rules**:

- **No imports**. Only Python standard library functions are used, except for 
  `pytest` for testing and `flake8` for PEP8 checking.
- Every algorithm must include **at least 3 doctests/examples**.
- Every algorithm must include **at least 5 test cases**, which should ideally 
  test edge cases.
- The **PEP8 style-guide** should be followed, this may be checked using the 
  `flake8` tool.

In addition, the following **guidelines** apply:

- Explicit variable names, detailed and concise inline comments. 
  Readability matters.
- Object orientation, generators, and so forth should be used when possible.
- Every algorithm should ideally include **at least one litterature** reference, 
  as well as algorithmic information about time and space usage.

# Contributing

You are encouraged to contribute, whatever your skill level is. Here's how to 
contribute:

1. Fork the project to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork to your local computer.
3. Add this to as upstream using `git remote add upstream https://github.com/tommyod/PythonAlgorithms.git`
4. Make your contribution to the project. Add tests, keep it clean, and follow 
   the rules outlined above.
5. Install flake8 using `pip install flake8`, then run 
   `flake8 --show-source --ignore=F811,W293,W391,W292,W291`. 
   Make sure there are no errors.
6. Run the tests using `pytest --doctest-modules -v`. Tests should run quickly, 
   and every algorithm should include at least 5 tests and 2 doctests.
7. Run `git fetch upstream` to get the lastest changes from upstream (this repo),
   then run `git rebase upstream/master` to rebase your changes on top of this 
   repo.
8. Create a pull request. Write in detail about what you did.

# Algorithms to implement

Here's a list of algorithms that should be considered.
For more information, see this [list of algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms) from Wikipedia.
Although the code quality is dubious, [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) has a list of algorithms.
Some "competing" GitHub repos are [TheAlgorithms/Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) and
[keon/algorithms](https://github.com/keon/algorithms), but again the code quality is debatable.
